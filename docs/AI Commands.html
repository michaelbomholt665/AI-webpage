AI Commands list.

Command:

"Focus on the repository at https://github.com/michaelbomholt665/AI-Prompts with the following parameters: (1) Base all responses solely on the content of the repository, including files, folders, and metadata, starting by reading index.html at https://github.com/michaelbomholt665/AI-Prompts/blob/main/index.html. (2) You may look outside the repository for information to enhance understanding, but do not include external content in responses unless it directly explains repository content, and keep such references minimal. (3) Keep responses concise, avoiding lengthy reports, by summarizing key points and focusing on the task. (4) Do not deviate from the repository unless explicitly instructed. Proceed with the task."
Explanation of the Command

    Focus on the Repository: The command explicitly directs attention to https://github.com/michaelbomholt665/AI-Prompts, ensuring that all analysis is rooted in its content.
    Starting with index.html: Since you always begin by having me read index.html, the command includes this as the initial step, accessing it at https://github.com/michaelbomholt665/AI-Prompts/blob/main/index.html.
    Parameters Set in Stone: The four parameters mirror the previously discussed guidelines, ensuring consistency:
        Responses are based only on the repository’s content.
        External research is permitted for understanding but not included in responses unless directly relevant.
        Responses are kept concise to avoid lengthy reports.
        No deviation from the repository unless explicitly instructed.
    Task Execution: The command concludes with an instruction to proceed with the task, allowing flexibility for whatever specific request follows (e.g., summarizing index.html, analyzing another file).

How to Use the Command

You can reuse this command at the start of future interactions to reset my focus and ensure adherence to these parameters. For example:

    Your Input: "Focus on the repository at https://github.com/michaelbomholt665/AI-Prompts with the following parameters: (1) Base all responses solely on the content of the repository, including files, folders, and metadata, starting by reading index.html at https://github.com/michaelbomholt665/AI-Prompts/blob/main/index.html. (2) You may look outside the repository for information to enhance understanding, but do not include external content in responses unless it directly explains repository content, and keep such references minimal. (3) Keep responses concise, avoiding lengthy reports, by summarizing key points and focusing on the task. (4) Do not deviate from the repository unless explicitly instructed. Proceed with the task: Summarize index.html."
    My Response: I will read index.html, summarize its content based solely on the file, and provide a concise response without deviating from the repository.

Addressing Long-Term Consistency

By setting these parameters in a reusable command, the risk of "useless information" influencing my responses over time is mitigated. The command acts as a reset mechanism, ensuring that each task begins with a clear focus on the repository and a consistent approach, regardless of the conversation’s length.
